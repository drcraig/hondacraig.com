        The idea is to have a cookout and potluck, some lawn games for the
        kids, and to invite you all to bring with you artifacts of the 
        neighborhood from your time here, however long or short; photographs, 
        maps, or simply stories to share.   During the party, we’ll have a 
        table out to put your artifacts on display.  Afterward, we’ll compile 
        copies of the things you bring as well as pictures from the party into 
        a little pamphlet/newsletter that can be a new artifact for the 
        future.
        </p>
        <h3>Interested in coming?</h3>
        <p>If so, please email Dan Craig so I can try to get some idea of a headcount.   Then just bring your families, a small dish or drinks, and whatever artifacts you’d like to share.  Feel free to invite others, too!
        </p>
        <h3>Interested in helping?</h3>
        <p>Hopefully it won’t be a complicated affair, but there are several areas where I could definitely use some assistance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bring a Grill: I have a grill, but it’s definitely not big enough to feed the block.  If you have one that’s portable, we can set them all up side-by-side in the driveway and grill together.</li>
            <li>Bring a Cooler</li>
            <li>Bring a folding Table or Chairs</li>
            <li>Help compiling the pamphlet/newsletter</li>
        </ul>
